===================

Convert mp3+lyc files to supermemoUX files

supermemo-convertor.hta is actually a .html file, except it only works on IE.

The recommended workflow is:
1. Download aboboo, which is a freeware.
2. Download supermemoUX, which is also for free.
3. Use aboboo to split a MP3 file, one sentense per file.
4. Output of step 3 => processed by this tool => Input of step 5.
5. Open supermemoUX, open the course you have generated in step 4, enjoy.
